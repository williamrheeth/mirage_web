about_me_description: Thermal infrared (TIR) imaging excels in low-visibility conditions, complementing RGB images for robust perception. However, the lack of large-scale, high-quality, aligned RGB-TIR datasets limits progress in multispectral tasks. While generating pseudo-TIR images from abundant RGB data can expand training sets, existing datasets lack the diversity needed to produce realistic TIR images for real-world applications. To address this, we present MIRAGE, a dataset of over 547k aligned RGB-TIR image pairs, covering diverse indoor and outdoor scenes, weather conditions, and sensor platforms. Crucially, MIRAGE includes both 8-bit tone-mapped images and raw 14-bit TIR data, enabling flexible tone-mapping strategies and mitigating biases introduced by fixed intensity transformations. Extensive benchmarks on translation models demonstrate that MIRAGE significantly enhances pixel-level fidelity, perceptual realism, and zero-shot generalization, particularly showcasing scalability for diffusion-based translation architectures. With its scale, diversity, and flexibility, MIRAGE provides a valuable resource for advancing robust multispectral translation methods in both research and practical applications.
